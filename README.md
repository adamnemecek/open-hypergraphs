# Open Hypergraphs

An implementation of [Data Parallel Algorithms for String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01041).
See also the [Python implementation](https://github.com/statusfailed/open-hypergraphs/).

Features:

- Algebraic construction by tensor and composition
- Functors, including optic transformation for reverse differentiation of morphisms
- Data-parallel diagram layering
